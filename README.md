# Kai-UI

A GUI for the Onslow College canteen/cafe that allows users to order items from an app on their computer. Note: this is a school project and will not be becoming a reality, also the submit order button is just a great big reset button at present as per the task instructions which can be found here: [https://onslowcollege.github.io/13dtc/programming/shop](url).
